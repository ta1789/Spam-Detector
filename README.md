# Spam Detector

Spam Detector is a machine learning-powered mobile application that helps identify spam and ham (non-spam) emails in your inbox. The app allows users to enter their email, password, and the source email ID (the email from which the messages are sent) to scan all the emails from the source and provide a count of spam and ham messages.

This application uses a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to classify emails based on a dataset of spam and ham emails from Kaggle.

## Features

- **Email Analysis**: Scan emails from a specific source email ID to classify them as spam or ham.
- **Spam/Ham Count**: Display the number of spam and ham emails from the source.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Kivy (for mobile application development)
- **Libraries**:
  - **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **numpy**: Handling arrays and matrices.
  - **scikit-learn**: Machine learning, used to train the model with the SVC algorithm.
